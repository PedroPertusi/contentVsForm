Rewrite the following essay by changing only its style (not its content) so that it matches a **lowest SAT style level (score 1)** in vocabulary, sentence structure, and mechanics.
Specifically, rewrite the text, while maintaining all the content intact, such that it:
- displays **fundamental problems in vocabulary**, with extremely limited or frequently inappropriate word choice that sometimes results in unclear or confusing statements;
- demonstrates **severe flaws in sentence structure**, with pervasive fragments, run-ons, and sentences that are often very hard to parse;
- contains **pervasive errors** in grammar, usage, and mechanics that persistently interfere with meaning and regularly make the text difficult or impossible to understand.

Remember: do not change the ideas, arguments, or examples. Only change wording, sentence structure, and correctness.
