Rewrite the following essay by changing only its style (not its content) so that it matches a **moderate SAT style level (score 4)** in vocabulary, sentence structure, and mechanics.
Specifically, rewrite the text, while maintaining all the content intact, such that it:
- uses **mostly basic but generally appropriate vocabulary**, with some repetition or vagueness;
- relies mainly on **simple or moderately varied sentence structures**, with some awkward or clumsy sentences;
- contains **noticeable errors** in grammar, usage, and mechanics that may distract at times but **rarely obscure** the overall meaning.

Remember: do not change the ideas, arguments, or examples. Only change wording, sentence structure, and correctness.
